# Random Quote Generator

A beginner project to practice gathering data from an API and displaying it on a webpage. This project makes a call from an API containing quotes about mankind ([Forismatic.com](http://forismatic.com/en/)) using JavaScript. One button refreshes the quote to a new random quote. Another button creates a tweet of the quote for you to post on Twitter.

In this project I learned:

 - **Making a simple API call:** Although I did not made the call in a more traditional method such as using AJAX or Fetch, I did learn to make an API call using a URL (building blocks and all that!). I learned how to identify the basic structure of a potential API URL and how to connect to an API using an API key.
 - **JSON:** Most web APIs transfer data in a format called JSON. JSON is nothing more than object properties (or ‘keys’) and their current values (‘values’, sandwiched between curly brackets. These properties and their values are often referred to as “key-value pairs”. Data from a server in a JSON format can be transmitted into webpages by selecting the specific key of the value required.
 - **CSS Shadows:** I also experimented with CSS shadows, giving the quote box a bit of texture.

Languages, frameworks, packages and toolkits used in this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
